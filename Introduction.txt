SQL tutorial from udemy. By colt:
1. Tutorial is based on MySql database. We are not trying to install MySql here. We will be using a container on c9.io website to run the mySql db.
2. Login to the c9 service. Create a new workspace and select any of the profile. We have selected html for minimal settings. Follow the below commands to use the mysql service.
	1. mysql-ctl start - Starts the db.
	2. mysql-ctl cli - Gives you the command line interface of the db.
	3. mysql-ctl stop - Stops the db services from running on the container.
	
3. Few more commands that you can try to execute on the sql cli are as follows:
	1. help - gives you the help menu. usgae help, help Integer etc.,
	2. select @@hostname - gives your name or the user session name.
	3. show databases - shows all the databases present in the database server.
	
SQL is case insensitive CREATE or create is same.
More preferably use CAPS.

Creating a database:
	CREATE DATABASE DB_NAME; Ex: CREATE DATABASE DogApp; or CREATE DATABASE soap_app;

Deleting a database:
		DROP DATABASE DB_NAME; Ex: DROP DATABASE DogApp;

Using a specific database:
	- Use the "USE" key word to specific which database you want to use to execute the later queries on.
	Ex: USE DB_NAME;
	- To confirm that you are using a specific database use the following command.
		select database(); -> Output should be DB_NAME;
	- If you are not using any database the result would be "null".

Tables: 
	- Store data in a relational structure.
	- Bascially in rows and columns.
	- An app can have many tables. Too many tables.
	- NOT ALL DATABASES USE TABLES TO STORE DATA.
Data Types:
	- Every column must specify what type of data it must hold. 
	- There are several data types available.
	- Primary types are classified as follows:
		1) Numerics : INT, SMALLINT, LONGINT,MEDIUMINT,BIGINT,DECIMAL,NUMERIC,FLOAT,DOUBLE,BIT
		2) Strings : CHAR, VARCHAR,BINARY,VARBIARY,BLOB,TINYBLOB,MEDIUMBLOB,LONGBLOB,TEXT,TINYTEXT,MEDIUMTEXT,LONGTEXT,ENUM
		3) Date : DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIME, YEAR.
